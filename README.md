# ExperienceShip
This program is a platform which will conect students with start-ups and companies. It aims to solve the problem where companies require high levels of experience for internship positions, which prevents students at university level from building experience.
Main functions of the platform:
  1. Students have access to database of all jobs available from companies that require little to no expereience
  2. Companies have access to database of students looking for internships
The platform will also account for issues such as Location of the job, Morning-vs-Afternoon of the job, etc...
